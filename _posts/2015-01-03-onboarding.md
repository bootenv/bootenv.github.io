## The just-arrived trainee

Don't loose time setting up new environments. Sharing passwords and credentials by email or chat is both inefficient and troublesome. Have your projects ready for lightning-fast onboarding with zero external configuration needed.

`>bootenv` makes the onboarding process easier and secure by taking care of providing everyone with the credentials they need without any effort.
