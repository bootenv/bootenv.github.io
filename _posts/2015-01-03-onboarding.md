## The just-arrived trainee

`>bootenv` it's not only good for running software on servers. Don't loose time setting up environments for new members of your projects. Sharing passwords and credentials by email or chat is both inefficient and troublesome, not to say dangerous. Have your projects ready for lightning-fast onboarding with as close to zero external configuration needed as possible.

`>bootenv` makes the onboarding process easier and secure by taking care of providing everyone with the credentials they need without any effort. A read-only, development `>bootenv` token can be checked in to source control, if pertinent, or otherwise provided to new commers as the only key they need to get all their project configuration. You can control exactly which keys from your configuration get exported by that token.
