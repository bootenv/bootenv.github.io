## Simple Environment Configuration Management 
`>bootenv` provides a simple service that makes it easy to setup configuration variables from a central server instead of hardcoding the values in configuration files. Wherever you are running software, you probably have to configure it with some precious and very secret private keys. `>bootenv` helps you keep those keys out of your code and out of trouble.
