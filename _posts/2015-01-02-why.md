## Why use bootenv?

Have you ever pushed, by mistake, say... your AWS secret keys to a public GitHub repository, and only realized that when Amazon called and you were owing them $25K already?

No... you wouldn't do that... probably not. But some colleage of yours might!!!

Keeping _configuration keys_, _passwords_ or any other _sensitive data_ on your code repository is dangerous. `>bootenv` helps you separate your environments' configuration from the code. By providing a centralized server and ready to use and straight-forward libraries for many languages, you can reduce the risk of security breaches because of unintentionally exposed data.
