## Why use bootenv?

Have you ever pushed, by mistake, your AWS secret keys to a public github repository, and only realized that when Amazon called and you were owing them $25K already?

No, probably not. But some colleage of yours might!!!

Keeping _configuration keys_, _passwords_ or any other _sensitive data_ on your code repository is dangerous.
